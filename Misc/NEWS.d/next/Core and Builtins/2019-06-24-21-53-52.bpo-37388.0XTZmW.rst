In development mode and in debug build, *encoding* and *errors* arguments are
now checked on string encoding and decoding operations. Examples: :func:`open`,
:meth:`str.encode` and :meth:`bytes.decode`.

By default, for best performances, the *errors* argument is only checked at the
first encoding/decoding error, and the *encoding* argument is sometimes ignored
for empty strings.
