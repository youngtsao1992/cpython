Reduce the number of unit tests run for the PGO generation task.  This
speeds up the task by a factor of about 15x.  Running the full unit test
suite is slow.  This change may result in a slightly less optimized build
since not as many code branches will be executed.  If you are willing to
wait for the much slower build, the old behavior can be restored using
'./configure [..] PROFILE_TASK="-m test --pgo-extended"'.  We make no
guarantees as to which PGO task set produces a faster build.  Users who
care should run their own relevant benchmarks as results can depend on
the environment, workload, and compiler tool chain.
